My config files for some *unix env.

I have only tested this on ubuntu 12.04 and Mac OS 10.7.4 and 10.8.2

Make sure you have:
  * for mac: homebrew
  * installed brew.sh or apt-get.sh

TODO
 remove all the .files and maybe put them on proper folder
 change logic to .bashrc instead of .bash_profile
