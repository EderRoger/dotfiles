My config files for some *unix env.

I have only tested this on ubuntu 12.04 and Mac OS 10.7.4.

Make sure you have:
  * installed the brew.sh or apt-get.sh first

To install a new plugin use Vundler and launch vim, run :BundleInstall

TODO
 remove all the .files and maybe put them on proper folder
 change logic to .bashrc instead of .bash_profile
